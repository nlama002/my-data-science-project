**Project Overview**
This project explores the NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset to analyze crash occurrences, contributing factors, and their impact across time and space. The goal is to uncover actionable insights for improving road safety. Using Python and Google Colab, the project includes steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, geospatial mapping, and addressing data ethics. The project culminates in a self-guided research question, with findings presented through a virtual poster.

**Goal**
Leverage data science to identify trends in motor vehicle crashes and provide safety improvement recommendations to the Department of Transportation.

**Key Features and tools used:**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Statsmodels

**Dataset:**
- NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions (Police-reported crashes)

**Milestones:**

**✅ 1. Environment Setup & Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Installed and configured necessary packages (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, etc.)

Loaded and cleaned raw crash datasets

Conducted initial EDA to understand distributions, missing values, and basic statistics

Visualized trends in crash volume and contributing factors


**✅ 2. Data Ethics & Preprocessing**
Addressed privacy and data sensitivity by reviewing dataset contents

Handled missing or incomplete values using imputation and filtering techniques

Normalized date/time and location formats for consistency

Ensured reproducibility and transparency in preprocessing steps


**✅ 3. Time Series Analysis of Crash Trends**
Grouped data by time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) to analyze crash frequency over time

Identified seasonal and cyclical trends in crashes

Explored the impact of external events (covid, holidays) on crash patterns


**✅ 4. Geospatial Analysis of Crash Locations**
Mapped crash data using geospatial tools (Folium, GeoPandas)

Identified crash hotspots and high-risk intersections

Created interactive maps to visualize incident density by borough and street
