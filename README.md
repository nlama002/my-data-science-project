**Project Overview**
This project explores the NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset to analyze crash occurrences, contributing factors, and their impact across time and space. The goal is to uncover actionable insights for improving road safety. Using Python and Google Colab, the project includes steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series analysis, geospatial mapping, and addressing data ethics. The project culminates in a self-guided research question, with findings presented through a virtual poster.

**Goal**
Leverage data science to identify trends in motor vehicle crashes and provide safety improvement recommendations to the Department of Transportation.

**Key Features and tools used:**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Statsmodels

**Dataset:**
- NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions (Police-reported crashes)

**Milestones:**
- Environment setup and basic EDA
- Data ethics and preprocessing
- Time series analysis of crash trends
- Geospatial analysis of crash locations
